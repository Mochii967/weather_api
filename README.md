# weather_api
This is me using a  weather api
I use the api in a very basic way, just simply getting the data from the 
server and displaying it. Although I do have to convert some of the data 
for the most part it is simply ddisplaying it. In this I also use the 
Material CSS to help with the styling, and I use jQuery to do all the actual 
dynamic things of the application.
